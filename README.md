# plink.nvim

## Introduction

A plugin to find more plugins.

**WARNING:** This plugin (like all my side projects) is a massive work in
progress, as in "pre-alpha".

## TODOs

- add telescope extension
  - also, ask yourself, is telescope the appropriate tool for this? Part of me
    thinks no...
- auto install plugins on selection
- allow sorting results by author, popularity, tags, etc.
- cache results locally
